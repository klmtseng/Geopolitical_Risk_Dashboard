        # For now, let's adjust the file dates drastically so that real utcnow() still works predictably for the test logic.

        # Re-calculate dates based on actual datetime.utcnow() for more robust testing without mocking utcnow directly in this step
        # This means the test is relative to the day it's run.
        # To make it deterministic as requested, we will hardcode file dates and use a fixed mock_today for cutoff calculation
        # *within the test logic*, but cleanup_old_data itself uses datetime.utcnow().
        # The prompt implies cleanup_old_data should be tested as is, so we'll use a fixed 'days_to_keep'
        # and create files very far in the past or very recent relative to actual runtime.

        # Let's stick to the fixed mock_today logic for creating files, and pass days_to_keep.
        # The key is that cleanup_old_data's internal `datetime.utcnow()` will be *later* than mock_today,
        # so files dated according to mock_today will appear "old" correctly.

        # For this test, let's use a very small `days_to_keep` and make files accordingly.
        # This is simpler than mocking `datetime.utcnow()` within `cleanup_old_data` without `pytest-mock`.
